### Repository Name: gap-filling_GOES-WFS

#### Description:
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the automation of filling gaps in the GOES Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, specifically targeting instances of invalid or cloudy data. The methodology employed leverages the Weather Forecasting System (WFS) model data to enhance the accuracy and completeness of the GOES LST dataset.

#### Features:

1. **Automated Gap-Filling:**
   - The repository provides automated tools for identifying and filling gaps in the GOES LST data.
   - Utilizes the WFS model data as a supplementary source to enhance the temporal and spatial coverage.

2. **Cloudy Data Handling:**
   - Specialized algorithms address the challenges posed by cloudy data, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable LST dataset.

3. **Integration with GOES Data:**
   - Seamless integration with GOES satellite data, maintaining the original structure while improving data quality.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

#### Installation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
